This is the folder for _bundled_ resources. If you place, or tinker with,
any resources here, they will not be seen or upgraded by next versions of Cura.

If you want your (unbundled or altered) resources to work after an upgrade,
please don't put them here, but install them either;
 - for materials: via the Marketplace (recommended if available),
 - by dragging a `.curapackage` file onto Cura,
 - or place it in the right sub-folder in the configuration folder* for Cura.

*) The configuration folder can be found by:
   Open up Help -> Show Configuration Folder
