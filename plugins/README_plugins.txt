This is the folder for _bundled_ plugins. If you place any other plugins here,
they will not be seen or upgraded by any next version of Cura.

If you want your (unbundled) plugins to work after an upgrade,
please don't put them here, but install them either;
 - via the Marketplace (recommended if available for that plugin),
 - by dragging a `.curapackage` file onto Cura,
 - or place it in the plugin folder in the configuration folder* for Cura.

*) The plugin sub-folder of the configuration folder can be found by:
   Open up Help -> Show Configuration Folder -> Navigate to the plugins folder.
