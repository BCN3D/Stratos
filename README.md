BCN3D Stratos
====

Slicing software specifically customized for our machines. Based on the open source project [Ultimaker/Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura.git) developed by Ultimaker B.V. in cooperation with the community.

Huge improvement over the [old Cura](https://github.com/BCN3D/Cura). New look, new user experience, new features, easier to use, all latest [ProGen](https://www.bcn3dtechnologies.com/en/sigma-progen/) profiles included. And all the parameters are adjustable to get the best of your BCN3D machine.

We've added specific features and improved the slicing process.

Custom features
---
- **Mirror and Duplication modes**: Unleash the full potential of your Sigmax. Choose new print modes to use both extruders at the same print. Cloning or mirroring the same model.
- **Prevent grinding filament**: Another advantadge of the IDEX technology. Now you can define a maximum number of retractions to be executed at the same piece of filament, when this number is reached the hotend will prime the right amount in the container to allow the extruder work on a new and clean piece of filament.
- **Heat only used hotends**: Winter is coming. Also for the unused hotend.
- **Smart purge**: Prime oozed material in the container. And only when it's needed. And only the right amount.
- **Reduce retraction**: Experimental feature to retract only on outer surface.
- **New theme**: Yes!
- **Custom fixes**: Adjusting temperature oscilation, zhops on tool changes and a few more. Specific for our IDEX machines.
